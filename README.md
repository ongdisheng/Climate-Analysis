# Climate-Analysis

## Background

The objective of the StopFire initiative is to anticipate and avert fires within Victorian cities. In pursuit of this goal, sensors have been strategically placed across multiple Victorian cities. Despite these efforts, the sheer magnitude of the data has impeded the timely provision of fire predictions using their current methods. Our role as data analysts involves the migration of this data to a NoSQL database, specifically MongoDB for enhanced efficiency. Furthermore, we are entrusted with the creation of an application utilizing Apache Kafka and Apache Spark to streamline the processes of data streaming, storage, and analysis.
